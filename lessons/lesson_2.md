# Week 2: Scanning

This week we'll be focused on Scanning. This will be the first technical portion of the Archilator project, so I expect you to be reading and writing a bit of code.

I'd like you to get started reading the chapter on scanning from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html). This chapter will be a bit heavy, and will cover a lot of concepts that won't be relevant for this project - but it will be usesful nonetheless.

# Homework
 - Fix the broken tests for scanning
 - Add your own tests to further test the functionality of the scanner
