There's a hitch. I'd like for you three to work together on getting one set of changes into this repository. This means that you're going to need to coordinate your changes for the code and test code to this codebase together.

Having three of you merge your changes into this repository paradoxically will take more work than just merging your changes into your own repository. I want you to get used to the challenges that come with working with others in tight quarters.

Like a cramped kitchen, I'd like for you to be as skilled with your knives and pots and flames when you're hip to hip as you would be with all the space to yourself.
