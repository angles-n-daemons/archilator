# Archilator

Welcome to the Archilator project! Hope you're excited to start learning about programming langauges.

Over the course of this project you'll learn how to build a real-live calculator, which is capable of calculating arbitrarily complex expressions. The goals are to develop a better understanding of software development, software testing and some algorithm / data structure principles.

This project leans heavily on the content from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), specifically Chapters 1, 2 and 4 - 7.

We'll also use blogs, youtube videos and things alike to supplement your learning. Let's get started!

# Getting started

To start on the Archilator project, you should clone down the repository to your personal machine.

Install the dependencies `npm i` and ensure that both the `npm start` and `npm test` commands work.

# Running tests

Why do you run tests?

# Homework

Your homework for this week will be focused on three high level goals.

 - Read [Chapter 2 of Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html). You only need to read the sections on Scanning, Parsing, Static Analysis - but feel free to read more if it interests you.
 - Watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6QfIXgjwGQ) on unit testing. Find some other material on the merits and drawbacks of unit testing.
 - To the best of your ability *try* to fix the five tests in the project. The first two should be easy! The rest will be difficult. Do not use the built in `eval` function provided by javascript.
   - The function you'll need to modify will be the `run` function in `calculator.js`.
 - Write five of your own tests so that you get used to writing tests. Try to see if you can get your own tests to pass.

I don't expect you to fix all of the tests. The goal of this week is to give you each a better understanding of the problem so we can begin to solve it over the coming weeks. Feel free to use any and all resources you'd like to utilize in your solution!
