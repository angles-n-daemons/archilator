# Archilator

This is the repository for the Archilator project. It's an education project that focuses on building a calculator in Javascript. Skills learned and used during this project will be basic Javascript, Unit Testing, and simple computer language mechanics.

It's inspired by [archilator](https://github.com/chris-chen-creates/archilator) built by a coworker of mine.
